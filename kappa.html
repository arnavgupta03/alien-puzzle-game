        <h1>Welcome to Planet Kappa!</h1>
        <p>
            If you're here, you must have bested the aliens on Planet Epsilon and Planet Zeta. But here, you face the Kappans. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As you land on the planet, you immediately notice a group of armed guards surround your ship. You're exhausted from the other planets, and so, you surrender. But, they don't let you go so easily. You first have to answer a series of questions. Also, your translator's still broken.

            They ask you: No ndu undl wregt yyu pge?
