            You have landed on Planet Epsilon. As soon as you deboard, you realize that your translator went back on the ship. But hey, you should be able to find another translator on the planet, right?

            Well, no. That didn't work out. And it turns out you need to be able to talk to the alien judge to let them know that you're on the planet to do research. And since they think you're crazy, they give you a skill testing question. Better be able to solve it quick!
